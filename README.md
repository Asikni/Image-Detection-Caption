Objective:

Develop a model which takes any screenshot as input and identifies the content visible on the screen.

The model should then generate a natural language understanding of what is present in the screenshot.

You may preprocess the image as you see fit and use techniques like optical character recognition to detect the text in the image. You are free to use any other approach to your imagination.
